# PHYS220/MATH220/CPSC220 CW 14

**Author(s):** **Amelia & Gwyneth**

## Specification

In this supplemental classwork, you will explore the differences between ```python/numpy``` and the established industry language ```MATLAB```. You will explore both the free clone Octave inside Jupyter, and native MATLAB on your lab computer (not inside CoCalc). Note that there is nothing to turn in: if you've created this repository, you are done. This material is purely for your own benefit so that you can jump straight into using MATLAB as needed.

1. Open the notebook `matlab-examples.ipynb` and follow the instructions.
1. Use the following resources from the info repository to quickly assess the similarities between Python and MATLAB:
  * [Python vs. MATLAB](http://www.pyzo.org/python_vs_matlab.html)
  * [MATLAB-Python Dictionary](http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-numpy.html)
  * [MATLAB Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/matlab/)
  * [Learn Matlab in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/matlab/)
  * [MATLAB-Julia-Python-R Comparison](http://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2014_matrix_cheatsheet.html)
1. You should also make sure that you install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/what-is-anaconda/) Python on your own machine, to familiarize yourself with how everything we learned in class can be done on your own computer. If you like the MATLAB interface (interpreter, editor, variables-list all in one window), there exists a Python development environment included in Anaconda that mimics it called [Spyder](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/). When developing in Python outside of CoCalc, you can use the Spyder environment (or any other editor/environment you choose).

## Assessment

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.
